##

Today we look at DT systems as difference equations and define the correspondence between linear, constant-coefficient difference equations (LCCDE) and linear, time-invariant (LTI) DT systems. We then see how to determine the impulse response of DT LTI systems. Today's lecture is a review of prerequisite material from ECE 2714.
