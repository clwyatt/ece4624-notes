In addition to the expression in the complex variable \\(z\\), the transform result includes a region-of-convergence (ROC), the allowed values of \\(z\\) in the domain of the function.\n\\(H(z)\\) is called the transfer function, system function, or Eigenvalue of the system.\nIf \\(h[n]\\) is causal then \\(H(z) = \\sum\\limits_{m = 0}^{\\infty}h[m]z^{-m}\\) is the unilateral (one-sided) Z-transform.\nThe ROC is a ring in the complex plane for the bilateral Z Transform, and a region outside some radius for the unilateral transform.\nFIGURE HERE\nAnother view of the one-sided transform is as the Laplace transform of a sampled causal signal. Recall the unilateral Laplace transform of a causal CT signal \\(x(t)\\) is\n\\[\nX(s) = \\int\\limits_{0}^{\\infty} x(t)\\, e^{-st}\\; dt\n\\]\nConsider a sampled version of the signal, with sample spacing \\(T\\) seconds\n\\[\nx[n] = x(nT) = \\sum\\limits_{n=0}^{\\infty} x(t)\\, \\delta(t - nT)\n\\]\nTaking the Laplace transform\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}\\left\\{x(nT) \\right\\} & = \\int\\limits_{0}^{\\infty} \\sum\\limits_{n=0}^{\\infty} x(t)\\, \\delta(t - nT) \\, e^{-st}\\; dt\\\\\n& = \\sum\\limits_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\int\\limits_{0}^{\\infty}  x(t)\\, \\delta(t - nT) \\, e^{-st}\\; dt\\\\\n& = \\sum\\limits_{n=0}^{\\infty}  x(nT) e^{-snT}\\\\\n& = \\sum\\limits_{n=0}^{\\infty}  x[n] z^{n}\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] where \\(z = e^{sT}\\).\nFrom this we see the ROC of the unilateral Laplace, \\(\\text{Re}(s) &gt; a\\) becomes \\(|z| &gt; e^{at}\\). Thus singularities in the left-hand of the \\(s\\)-plane map to singularities inside the unit-circle of the \\(z\\)-plane, while singularities in the right-hand side of the \\(s\\)-plane map to singularities outside the unit circle of the \\(z\\)-plane.\nFIGURE HERE\nSome standard examples to remind us of the techniques involved.\n\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{Z}\\left\\{ \\delta[n] \\right\\} & = \\sum\\limits_{n = -\\infty}^{\\infty}\\delta[n]z^{-n}\\\\\n& = z^{-0}\\\\\n& = 1\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] and the ROC is the entire \\(z\\)-plane.\n\n\n\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{Z}\\left\\{ u[n] \\right\\} & = \\sum\\limits_{n = -\\infty}^{\\infty}u[n]z^{-n}\\\\\n& = \\sum\\limits_{n = 0}^{\\infty}z^{-n}\\\\\n& = \\lim_{N \\rightarrow \\infty} \\sum\\limits_{n = 0}^{N}z^{-n}\\\\\n& = \\lim_{N \\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{z^{-(N+1)} - 1}{z^{-1} - 1}\\\\\n& = \\frac{-1}{z^{-1} - 1} \\quad \\text{for } |z| &gt; 1\\\\\n& = \\frac{z}{z-1}\n\\end{aligned}\\]\nwhere the ROC, determined from the convergence criteria is \\(|z| &gt; 1\\).\n\n\n\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{Z}\\left\\{ a^n\\,u[n] \\right\\} & = \\sum\\limits_{n - 0}^{\\infty}a^n\\, z^{-n}\\\\\n& = \\sum\\limits_{n = 0}^{\\infty}\\left(\\frac{z}{a}\\right)^{-n}\\\\\n& = \\lim_{N \\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{\\left(\\frac{z}{a}\\right)^{-(N+1)} - 1}{\\left(\\frac{z}{a}\\right)^{-1} - 1}\\\\\n& = \\frac{-1}{\\left(\\frac{z}{a}\\right)^{-1} - 1} \\quad \\text{for } |z| &gt; |a|\\\\\n& = \\frac{z}{z-a}\n\\end{aligned}\\]\nwhere the ROC, determined from the convergence criteria is \\(|z| &gt; |a|\\)."

Those courses are the foundation of DSP, and we will review and use the theory of linear, time-invariant, discrete-time systems. However both courses focus mostly on analysis with only introductory coverage of design and implementation.\nIn addition those courses neglected the effect of quantization – the need to represent signal samples and filter coefficients as fixed-width integers for efficient implementation, rather than floating-point numbers. Knowing how to model and consider quantization effects is an important part of designing and implementing practical DSP systems.\nAt the end of the course we introduce stochastic, or random, signals. Learning about stochastic signals opens up a broader world of more sophisticated concepts, including the idea of adaptive filtering, and applications, such as noise cancellation."

The lab-in-a-box kit from ECE 1004 should include everything you need.\nYou will also need a power supply, two-channel oscilloscope, and function generator. Integrated USB devices and associated software are suitable, e.g. the Digilent Analog Discovery 2 (AD2). Loaners for the AD2 are available.\n\nIMPORTANT: You are required to purchase an Arduino UNO R4 Minima, the microcontroller development board we will be using this semester. It is widely available for about $20 USD. You will also need a USB C cable (and possibly an adapter) for flashing the board from your laptop. You will have to install a freely available development environment for this board, as well as a general C and C++ compiler for your host computer (MSVC, GCC, or Clang)."

Those courses are the foundation of DSP, and we will review and use the theory of linear, time-invariant, discrete-time systems. However both courses focus mostly on analysis with only introductory coverage of design and implementation.\nIn addition those courses neglected the effect of quantization – the need to represent signal samples and filter coefficients as fixed-width integers for efficient implementation, rather than floating-point numbers. Knowing how to model and consider quantization effects is an important part of designing and implementing practical DSP systems.\nAt the end of the course we introduce stochastic, or random, signals. Learning about stochastic signals opens up a broader world of more sophisticated concepts, including the idea of adaptive filtering, and applications, such as noise cancellation."

If you prefer you can also use Python with the SimPy, NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib packages.\nYou will also need a solderless breadboard, at least four LF356N op-amps or equivalent, as well as a selection of resistors, capacitors, and 22 AWG solid hookup wire and wire strippers (or a selection of pre-cut jumpers). The lab-in-a-box kit from ECE 1004 should include everything you need.\nYou will also need a power supply, two-channel oscilloscope, and function generator. Integrated USB devices and associated software are suitable, e.g. the Digilent Analog Discovery 2 (AD2). Loaners for the AD2 are available.\n\nIMPORTANT: You are required to purchase an Arduino UNO R4 Minima, the microcontroller development board we will be using this semester. It is widely available for about $20 USD. You will also need a USB C cable (and possibly an adapter) for flashing the board from your laptop. You will have to install a freely available development environment for this board, as well as a general C and C++ compiler for your host computer (MSVC, GCC, or Clang)."
