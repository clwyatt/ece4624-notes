Those courses are the foundation of DSP, and we will review and use the theory of linear, time-invariant, discrete-time systems. However both courses focus mostly on analysis with only introductory coverage of design and implementation.\nIn addition those courses neglected the effect of quantization – the need to represent signal samples and filter coefficients as fixed-width integers for efficient implementation, rather than floating-point numbers. Knowing how to model and consider quantization effects is an important part of designing and implementing practical DSP systems.\nAt the end of the course we introduce stochastic, or random, signals. Learning about stochastic signals opens up a broader world of more sophisticated concepts, including the idea of adaptive filtering, and applications, such as noise cancellation."

It is widely available for about $20 USD. You will also need a USB C cable (and possibly an adapter) for flashing the board from your laptop.

Those courses are the foundation of DSP, and we will review and use the theory of linear, time-invariant, discrete-time systems. However both courses focus mostly on analysis with only introductory coverage of design and implementation.\nIn addition those courses neglected the effect of quantization – the need to represent signal samples and filter coefficients as fixed-width integers for efficient implementation, rather than floating-point numbers. Knowing how to model and consider quantization effects is an important part of designing and implementing practical DSP systems.\nAt the end of the course we introduce stochastic, or random, signals. Learning about stochastic signals opens up a broader world of more sophisticated concepts, including the idea of adaptive filtering, and applications, such as noise cancellation."

The lab-in-a-box kit from ECE 1004 should include everything you need.\nYou will also need a power supply, two-channel oscilloscope, and function generator. Integrated USB devices and associated software are suitable, e.g. the Digilent Analog Discovery 2 (AD2). Loaners for the AD2 are available.\n\nIMPORTANT: You are required to purchase an Arduino UNO R4 Minima, the microcontroller development board we will be using this semester. It is widely available for about $20 USD. You will also need a USB C cable (and possibly an adapter) for flashing the board from your laptop. You will have to install a freely available development environment for this board, as well as a general C and C++ compiler for your host computer (MSVC, GCC, or Clang)."

That is the Fourier transform at each continuous frequency \\(\\omega\\) is scaled by the frequency response at that frequency.\nWe can use this behavior to our advantage. In many applications we want to modify the values of \\(a_k\\) or \\(X(j\\omega)\\) selectively, passing them unmodified, increasing (amplifying) them, or decreasing (attenuating) them. This is accomplished by designing a frequency response. Such systems are called frequency selective filters and come in 4 basic types.\nWe will be discussing filters in much more detail later. For now we just need to define one of the types, the lowpass filter."

    "text": "Practical Lowpass Filters\nIdeal CT filters cannot be implemented in practice because they are non-causal and thus physically impossible.\nPractical filters are described by a frequency response that is a ratio of two polynomials in \\(j\\omega\\), i.e. \\[H(j\\omega) = \\frac{K \\cdot(j\\omega - \\beta_1)\\cdot(j\\omega - \\beta_2)\\cdots (j\\omega - \\beta_M)}{(j\\omega - \\alpha_1)\\cdot(j\\omega - \\alpha_2)\\cdots (j\\omega - \\alpha_N)}\\] where \\(K\\) is a constant that controls the gain at DC, and the zero or more complex coefficients \\(\\beta_k\\) and the one or more complex coefficients \\(\\alpha_k\\) are called the zeros and poles of the filter respectively.\nPractical filters differ from ideal filters in that they cannot be zero over any finite range of frequencies and cannot transition discontinuously between stop and pass bands. Instead they must vary over the bands and transition smoothly, with a degree of variation and sharpness that is a function of the order of the filter and the exact form of the frequency response polynomials. Thus practical filters are described by additional parameters that define the stop and pass-bands."

Since the magnitude and phase allow us to directly see the system behavior at a given frequency, those plots are much more useful.\nRather than simply plot the magnitude and phase as a function of \\(\\omega\\), it is common to change the abscissa (horizontal / \\(\\omega\\)-axis) to be on a logarithmic scale and so only plot the positive frequency portion of the spectrum.\nPlotting on a log-scale compresses this information horizontally so that we can see how a wide range of frequency content is scaled. When plotting the magnitude spectrum it is also common to make the ordinate (vertical / gain axis) to be in decibels (dB).\nThus the magnitude of the frequency response in dB is \\(20 \\log_{10} |H(j\\omega)|\\). When the frequency response is plotted this particular way we get what is called a Bode plot."

Instead they must vary over the bands and transition smoothly, with a degree of variation and sharpness that is a function of the order of the filter and the exact form of the frequency response polynomials.
