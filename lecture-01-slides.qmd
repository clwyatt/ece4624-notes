## Overview of ECE 4624 DSP and Filter Design

-   This course covers the analysis, design, and realization of digital
    filters and their application to signal processing and control.
-   It uses the techniques and concepts from ECE 2714 and 3704. Those
    courses are the foundation of DSP, and we will review and use the
    theory of linear, time-invariant, discrete-time systems. However
    both courses focus mostly on analysis with only introductory
    coverage of design and implementation.
-   In addition those courses neglected the effect of quantization â€“ the
    need to represent signal samples and filter coefficients as
    fixed-width integers for efficient implementation, rather than
    floating-point numbers. Knowing how to model and consider
    quantization effects is an important part of designing and
    implementing practical DSP systems.
-   At the end of the course we introduce stochastic, or random,
    signals. Learning about stochastic signals opens up a broader world
    of more sophisticated concepts, including the idea of adaptive
    filtering, and applications, such as noise cancellation.

## The learning objectives for the course are:

Having successfully completed this course, the student will be able to:

1.  Evaluate the performance of a digital filter, in terms of its
    frequency response.
2.  Use Fast Fourier Transform techniques for the analysis of arbitrary
    signals.
3.  Demonstrate coefficient quantization effects in digital filters.
4.  Design digital filters using transformation techniques from analog
    designs.
5.  Design digital filters using windowing techniques.
6.  Design digital filters meeting given specifications.
7.  Organize and write technical reports.
8.  Organize and make technical presentations.

## LO1: Evaluate the performance of a digital filter, in terms of its frequency response

Example Problem: Given a low-pass filter described by the difference
equation $$
  y[n] = ay[n-1] + by[n-2] + cy[n-3] + dx[n] + ex[n-1] + fx[n-2]
  $$ where the coefficients $a$ through $f$ are given and whose
transition band is defined from -3dB to -40dB, determine the cutoff
frequency and width of the transition band in samples/sec.

## LO2: Use Fast Fourier Transform techniques for the analysis of arbitrary signals

Example Problem: Given samples of a real single-channel signal in the
file `sig.wav` sampled at 18kHz determine the relative power between the
frequency bands DC-500Hz and 1kHz-1.5kHz.

## LO3: Demonstrate coefficient quantization effects in digital filters

Example Problem: Given a 5th order IIR bandpass filter with coefficients
limited to 8 bits, plot the frequency response with and without
quantization. What is the maximum expected deviation in the bandwidth of
the filter due to quantization?

## LO4: Design digital filters using transformation techniques from analog designs

Example Problem: Consider an analog filter with transfer function $$
  H(s) = \frac{K(s-a)}{(s+b)(s+c)(s+d)}
  $$ Using the bilateral transform, derive an equivalent DT filter.

## LO5: Design digital filters using windowing techniques

Example Problem: Given an IIR filter whose impulse response is given by
$h[n]$, design a comparable FIR filter using a Hamming window of length
61.

## LO6: Design digital filters meeting given specifications

Example Problem: Consider a low-pass DT filter whose -3dB frequency is
$\frac{\pi}{8}$ rad/sample with a transition band to -40dB less than
$\frac{\pi}{12}$, and pass-band ripple less than 3%. Design a
Butterworth IIR filter meeting these specifications.

    real-time specifications. (ECE 2564)

**Important note for graduate students:** If you have enrolled in this
course via a force add and lack the equivalent prerequisite knowledge,
please be advised that you may find the material particularly
challenging.

## Course Textbook and Reference Material

The official textbook is Proakis, John G. and Dimitris G. Manolakis,
Digital Signal Processing Principles, Algorithms, and Applications, 4th
edition (denoted PM).

You can find used copies at a reasonable price. Earlier (3rd) or later
(5th) editions of the text can also be used.

I also provide supplementary notes but they should not be considered a
replacement for the textbook.

The following references will also be used, which are freely available:

-   Arduino UNO R4 Minima User Manual
-   Renesas RA4M1 Group Userâ€™s Manual: Hardware
-   Renesas Flexible Software Package (FSP) Userâ€™s Manual
-   Cortex-M4 Devices Generic User Guide

## Lab Material Requirements

You need:

-   Matlab or Octave for general computation, plotting, data analysis,
    and filter design tools. If you prefer you can also use Python with
    the SimPy, NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib packages.
-   You will also need a solderless breadboard, at least four LF356N
    op-amps or equivalent, as well as a selection of resistors,
    capacitors, and 22 AWG solid hookup wire and wire strippers (or a
    selection of pre-cut jumpers). The lab-in-a-box kit from ECE 1004
    should include everything you need.
-   You will also need a power supply, two-channel oscilloscope, and
    function generator. Integrated USB devices and associated software
    are suitable, e.g. the Digilent Analog Discovery 2 (AD2). Loaners
    for the AD2 are available.

**IMPORTANT:** You are required to purchase an Arduino UNO R4 Minima,
the microcontroller development board we will be using this semester. It
is widely available for about \$20 USD. You will also need a USB C cable
(and possibly an adapter) for flashing the board from your laptop. You
will have to install a freely available development environment for this
board, as well as a general C and C++ compiler for your host computer
(MSVC, GCC, or Clang).

## Class Meetings

Most class meetings you will be responsible for:

1.  Reading a section of the textbook and/or notes

2.  Attending the class meeting, participating, and asking questions

3.  Filling out a weekly survey

Consistent preparation for class reduces procrastination and smooths out
your weekly workload. The better prepared you are for class, the more
you will get out of our meetings.

## Problem Sets

-   Problems sets are released on Mondays and generally due the
    following Wednesday.
-   The first problem set covers CT/DT signals and the CT Fourier
    Transform. It is due Wed 9/10 [through Canvas]{.underline}.
-   You should typeset your solutions, use an annotating program on the
    PDF, or scan work done with pencil and paper (the free Adobe Scan
    app works well).
-   You can insert pages if needed but maintain the question ordering.
-   **Illegible submissions will not be graded.**

You are encouraged to work in small groups on the problem sets. However
you must write up solutions in your own words and submit them
individually.

## Honor Code Policy for Problem Sets

-   The problem sets must be completed individually. However, I strongly
    encourage you to discuss and work the problems with other students.

-   A group of two or three works well. In these groups you are allowed
    to work through the problems together.

-   To write up your solutions, you may not refer to any jointly created
    notes.

-   Your submitted solution should credit any student with whom you
    worked/discussed problems.

-   You must be able to explain and duplicate all the steps in any work
    you submit.

See the syllabus for full details.

## Permissible AI Use

In this course, use of generative AI tools is permitted for all
assignments, given that the student is using the AI tool to contribute
to their learning of the course content, but not to replace original
work.

-   You must properly acknowledge when and how AI tools have been used
    in your submissions.
-   Failure to disclose AI use or submitting AI-generated work as
    entirely your own without critical engagement will constitute a
    violation of the Honor Code.

If you are ever uncertain about the use of AI, it is your responsibility
to ask me before proceeding.

## Labs

In addition to problem sets you will have four labs:

-   Lab 1: Identity system with MCU, anti-aliasing and reconstruction
    filters
-   Lab 2: DFT based filters on a general-purpose computer
-   Lab 3: FIR implementation on MCU
-   Lab 4: IIR design and implementation on MCU with report and
    presentation

You will need:

-   The kit from ECE 1004/2024 or equivalent (solderless breadboard,
    components, power supply, oscilloscope, function generator, and
    associated software)

-   An Arduino Uno R4 Minima (\$20 USD)

-   Matlab (and the signal processing toolbox) or equivalent

-   C++ Compiler (e.g. from ECE 2514)

-   VSCode with the PlatformIO extension (freely available)

Loaners for the AD2 will be available soon.

## Exams

-   There a midterm exam and a cumulative final exam, together making up
    50% of the grade.
-   These will be in-person and closed-book.
-   You will be allowed one 8.5â€™â€™ x 11â€™â€™ sheet of crib notes for the
    midterm exam.
-   You will be allowed two 8.5â€™â€™ x 11â€™â€™ sheet of crib notes for the
    final exam.
-   You are allowed to bring a graphing, scientific, or basic
    calculator.
-   Other electronic devices including cell phone, laptop, iPad, smart
    watch, etc. are prohibited.
-   Only foam ear-plugs are allowed (no earbuds or over the ear
    headphones).

## Grading

Grades are based on the following weights:

-   Homework Problem Sets: 10% (weighted equally)
-   Labs: 40% (not weighted equally)
-   Midterm Exam: 25%
-   Final Exam: 25%

See the syllabus on the Canvas site for full policy and administrative
details, including late work.

## Reminders and Next Actions

-   Read the Syllabus if you have not already
-   Read PM Chapter 1 and Chapter 2
-   Refer to as needed Chapters 1 and 2 of ECE 2714 Supplementary Notes
