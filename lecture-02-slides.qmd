## Signals as Functions

In order to reason about signals mathematically we need a representation or *model*. Signals are modeled as functions, mappings between sets
$$
f: A \rightarrow B
$$
where $A$ is a set called the *domain* and $B$ is a set called the *range*.

The most basic classification of signals depends on the sets that makeup the domain and co-domain. We will be interested in two versions of the domain, the reals denoted $\mathbb{R}$ and the integers denoted $\mathbb{Z}$. We will be interested in two versions of the co-domain, the reals $\mathbb{R}$ and the set of complex numbers $\mathbb{C}$.

## Analog Signals

If the function $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, we call this an analog or real, continuous-time signal, e.g. a voltage at time $t \in \mathbb{R}$, $v(t)$. We will write these as $x(t)$, $y(t)$, etc. The units of $t$ are seconds. @fig-analog-plots shows some graphical representations, i.e. plots.

```{python}
#| label: fig-analog-plots
#| fig-cap: "Example plots of analog signals."
#| fig-alt: "Example plots of analog signals. Shows a plot of the unit step, causal real exponential, sinusoid, and a damped causal sinusoid."

import matplotlib
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

t = np.linspace(-6, 6, 1000);
u = (t >= 0)
e = np.exp(-t)*u
s = np.sin(2*np.pi*t)
es = e*s

f = plt.figure()

plt.subplot(2, 2, 1)
plt.plot(np.linspace(-6, 0, 1000), np.zeros(1000), color='b')
plt.plot(np.linspace(0, 6, 1000), np.ones(1000), color='b')
plt.xlabel('$t$')
plt.ylabel('$x(t)$')
plt.title('$x(t) = u(t)$')
plt.autoscale(enable=True, axis='x', tight=True)

plt.subplot(2, 2, 2)
plt.plot(t,e)
plt.xlabel('$t$')
plt.ylabel('$x(t)$')
plt.title('$x(t) = e^{-t}u(t)$')
plt.autoscale(enable=True, axis='x', tight=True)

plt.subplot(2, 2, 3)
plt.plot(t,s)
plt.xlabel('$t$')
plt.ylabel('$x(t)$')
plt.title('$x(t) = sin(2\pi t)$')
plt.autoscale(enable=True, axis='x', tight=True)

plt.subplot(2, 2, 4)
plt.plot(t,es)
plt.xlabel('$t$')
plt.ylabel('$x(t)$')
plt.title('$x(t) = e^{-t}sin(2\pi t)u(t)$')
plt.autoscale(enable=True, axis='x', tight=True)

plt.tight_layout()

plt.show()
```

## Real, Discrete-time Signal

If the function $f: \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, we call this a real, discrete-time signal, e.g. the temperature every day at noon. We will write these as $x[n]$, $y[n]$, etc. Note $n$ is dimensionless. @fig-realdt-plots shows some graphical representations.

```{python}
#| label: fig-realdt-plots
#| fig-cap: "Example plots of real-valued, discrete-time signals."
#| fig-alt: "Example plots of real-valued, discrete-time signals. Shows a plot of the unit step, causal real exponential, sinusoid, and a damped causal sinusoid."

import matplotlib
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

n = np.linspace(-6, 6, 13);
u = (n >= 0)
e = np.exp(-n)*u
s = np.sin(n)
es = e*s

f = plt.figure()

plt.subplot(2, 2, 1)
plt.stem(n, u)
plt.xlabel('$n$')
plt.ylabel('$x[n]$')
plt.title('$x[n] = u[n]$')
plt.autoscale(enable=True, axis='x', tight=True)

plt.subplot(2, 2, 2)
plt.stem(n,e)
plt.xlabel('$n$')
plt.ylabel('$x[n]$')
plt.title('$x[n] = e^{-n}u[n]$')
plt.autoscale(enable=True, axis='x', tight=True)

plt.subplot(2, 2, 3)
plt.stem(n,s)
plt.xlabel('$n$')
plt.ylabel('$x[n]$')
plt.title('$x[n] = sin(n)$')
plt.autoscale(enable=True, axis='x', tight=True)

plt.subplot(2, 2, 4)
plt.stem(n,es)
plt.xlabel('$n$')
plt.ylabel('$x[n]$')
plt.title('$x[n] = e^{-n}sin(n)u[n]$')
plt.autoscale(enable=True, axis='x', tight=True)

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

## Some other possibilities
  
* $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}$, discrete-valued, continuous-time signals
* $f: \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}$,  discrete-valued, discrete-time signals

The co-domain can also be complex.

* $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$, complex-valued, continuous-time signals, e.g.
  $$
  x(t) = e^{j\omega t} = \cos(\omega t) + j\sin(\omega t)
  $$
* $f: \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$, complex-valued, discrete-time signals, e.g.
  $$
  x[n] = e^{j\omega n} = \cos(\omega n) + j\sin(\omega n)
  $$

  
Since the domains $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{Z}$ are usually interpreted as time, we call these _time-domain_ signals. In the time-domain, when the co-domain is $\mathbb{R}$ we call these real signals. All physical signals are real. However pairs of complex signals are important mathematical models in linear systems theory.

## Digital Signals

We are ultimately interested in signals

$$
f: \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{Q}
$$

where the range $\mathbb{Q} \subset \mathbb{Z}^+$ is the set of unsigned $N$-bit values

$$
\sum\limits_{i = -A}^{B} b_i 2^{-i}
$$

* $b_i \in\{0,1\}$ it the ith bit
* $b_{-A}$ is the most-signifigant bit (MSB)
* $b_{B}$ is the least-signifigant bit (LSB)
* the location of the decimal point is implied
* signed values have various representations

However, these functions are hard to work with mathematically, so we generally work with DT signals and look at practical consequencces separately.

## Primitive Models

We mathematically model signals by combining elementary/primitive functions, for example:
  
* polynomials: $x(t) = t$, $x(t) = t^2$, etc.
* transendental functions: $x(t) = e^t$, $x(t) = \sin(t)$, $x(t) = \cos(t)$, etc.
* piecewise functions, e.g.
  $$
     x(t) = \left\{  \begin{array}{cl}
       f_1(t) & t < 0\\
       f_2(t) & t \geq 0\\
     \end{array}\right.
  $$


## Unit Step Function

To model turning signals on we often use a piecewise function, the unit-step

In continuous-time:

$$
u(t) = \left\{  \begin{array}{cl}
        0 & t < 0\\
        1 & t \geq 0\\
      \end{array}\right.
$$

Note: some texts define the step function at $t=0$ to be $0$ or $\frac{1}{2}$.

In discrete-time:

$$
u[n] = \left\{  \begin{array}{cl}
        0 & n < 0\\
        1 & n \geq 0\\
      \end{array}\right.
$$

Note: there is no ambiguity about the value at $n=0$.

## Unit Impulse Function

An important signal in linear system theory is the impulse function:

It is easily defined in discrete-time:

$$
\delta[n] = \left\{  \begin{array}{cl}
        0 & n \neq 0\\
        1 & n = 0\\
      \end{array}\right.
$$

However in continuous-time it is defined using generalized functions. Two definitions:

$$
\delta(t) = \lim_{\epsilon \rightarrow 0}\left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
  \frac{1}{2\epsilon} & |t| < \epsilon\\
  0 & \text{else}
\end{array}
\right.
$$

$$
\delta(t) = \lim_{\epsilon \rightarrow 0} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\epsilon} e^{-\frac{t^2}{2\epsilon^2}}
$$

Note the area under each definition is always one.

## CT Impulse Function cont.

In practice we can often use the following heuristic definition and some properties, without worrying about the distribution functions.
$$
\delta(t) = \left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
  0 & t \neq 0\\
  \infty & t = 0
\end{array}
\right. 
$$

* The area under the unit impulse is unity since by definition
  $$
  \int\limits_{-\infty}^{\infty} \delta(t) \; dt = 1
  $$
* Sampling property: $x(t)\delta(t-t_0) = x(t_0)\delta(t-t_0)$
* Sifting Property:
  $$
  \int\limits_{a}^{b} x(t)\delta(t-t_0) \; dt = x(t_0)
  $$
  for any $a < t_0 < b$.

## Relationships between the unit step and impulse in CT

We previously defined the unit step function. The impulse can be defined in terms of the step:
$$
\delta(t) = \frac{du}{dt}
$$
and vice-versa
$$
u(t) = \int\limits_{-\infty}^{t} \delta(\tau) \; d\tau
$$
using the notion of distributions, e.g.

$$
u(t) = \int\limits_{-\infty}^{t} \delta(\tau) \; d\tau = \lim_{\epsilon \rightarrow 0} \int\limits_{-\infty}^{t} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\epsilon} e^{-\frac{\tau^2}{2\epsilon^2}} \; d\tau = \lim_{\epsilon \rightarrow 0} \frac{1}{2}\left(1+\text{erf}\left( \frac{t}{\sqrt{2}\epsilon}\right)\right)
$$

## Variations on the step and impulse in CT

We can apply additional transformations to the impulse and step functions to get other useful signals, e.g.


* ramp
  $$
  r(t) = \int\limits_{-\infty}^{t} u(\tau) \; d\tau = tu(t)
  $$
* causal pulse of width $\epsilon$
  $$
  p(t) = u(t) - u(t-\epsilon)
  $$
* non-causal pulse of width $2\epsilon$
  $$
      p(t) = u(t+\epsilon) - u(t-\epsilon)
  $$


## Relationships between the unit step and impulse in DT

Some useful properties of the DT impulse function are:

- Energy is 1: $\sum\limits_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} \delta[n] = 1$

- Sampling: $x[n]\delta[n-n_0] = x[n_0]\delta[n-n_0]$

- Sifting: $\sum\limits_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} x[n]\delta[n-n_0] = x[n_0]$

The impulse can be defined in terms of the step and vice-versa:
$$\delta[n] = u[n] - u[n-1]$$ 

$$u[n] = \sum\limits_{m=-\infty}^{n} \delta[m]$$ or

$$u[n] = \sum\limits_{k=0}^{\infty} \delta[n-k]$$

## Complex Exponential in CT

One of the most important signals in systems theory is the complex exponential:
$$
x(t) = C\, e^{a t}
$$
where the parameters $C, a \in \mathbb{C}$ in general.

* When $C$ and $a$ are both real ($\Im(C) = \Im(a) = 0$), we have the familiar exponential. 

## Complex Exponential in CT cont.

To get the pure sinusoidal case, let $C \in \mathbb{R}$ and $a$ be purely imaginary: $a = j\omega_0$:
$$
x(t) = Ce^{j\omega_0 t}
$$
where $\omega_0$ is the frequency (in radians/sec). This is called the complex sinusoid.

By Euler's identity:
$$
e^{j\omega_0 t} = \cos(\omega_0 t) + j\sin(\omega_0 t)
$$
and
$$
\Re(x(t)) = \cos(\omega_0 t) = \frac{1}{2}\left( e^{j\omega_0 t} + e^{-j\omega_0 t} \right)
$$

$$
\Im(x(t)) = \sin(\omega_0 t) = \frac{1}{2j}\left( e^{j\omega_0 t} - e^{-j\omega_0 t} \right)
$$
are both real sinusoids.

## Complex Exponential in CT cont.

When the parameter $C$ is complex we get a phase shift. Again let $a = j\omega_0$. When $C$ is complex we can write it as $C = Ae^{j\phi}$ where $A = |C|$ and $\phi = \angle C$. Then

$$
x(t) = Ae^{j\phi} e^{j\omega_0 t} = Ae^{j(\omega_0 t+\phi)} 
$$
and
$$
\Re(x(t)) = A\cos(\omega_0 t+\phi) 
$$

$$
\Im(x(t)) = A\sin(\omega_0 t+\phi) 
$$

Since $\sin$ is a special case of $\cos$, i.e. $\cos(\theta) = \sin(\theta + \frac{\pi}{2})$, the general real sinusoid is

$$
A\cos(\omega_0 t + \phi)
$$
  
* $A$ is called the amplitude
* $\omega_0$ is again the frequency in radians/sec.
* $\phi$ is called the phase shift and is related to a time shift $T_s$ by
  $$
  \phi = \omega_0T_s
  $$

## Complex Exponential in DT


The DT Complex Exponential is defined in a similar fashion the the CT
version, but with some important differences. 

The general DT complex exponential is given by the expression: 

$$x[n] = Ce^{\beta n}$$ 

where in general $C \in \mathbb{C}$ and $\beta \in \mathbb{C}$. 

It is usually more convenient to write this as

$$x[n] = C \alpha^n$$ 

where $\alpha = e^{j\theta}$ is a complex number $\alpha = \cos(\theta) + j\sin(\theta)$.

## Basic Transformations (focusing on DT)

We can also apply transformations to signals to increase their modeling flexibility.

- magnitude scaling $$x_2[n] = a x_1[n]$$ for $a \in \mathbb{R}$.

- time differences $$x_2[n] = x_1[n] - x_1[n-1]$$

- running sums $$x_2[n] = \sum\limits_{m = -\infty}^{n} x_1[m]$$

- sums $$y[n] = \sum\limits_{i} x_i[n]$$ 

## Basic DT Transformations cont.

- multiplication (modulation) $$y[n] = x_1[n] x_2[n]$$

- time index shift $$x_2[n] = x_1[n+m]$$

  - if $m < 0$ it is called a *delay*

  - if $m > 0$ it is called an *advance*

- time reversal $$x_2[n] = x_1[-n]$$

## Basic DT Transformations cont.

- decimation $$y[n] = x[m n]$$ for $m \in \mathbb{Z}^+$.

  - e.g. for $m=2$ only keep every other sample

  - e.g. for $m=3$ only keep every third sample

  - etc.

- interpolation $$y[n] = \left\{  \begin{array}{cl}
  x\left[ \frac{n}{m}\right] & n = 0\; , \; \pm m, , \; \pm 2m \cdots\\
  0 & \mbox{else}
  \end{array}\right.$$ When $m = 2$ this inserts a zero sample between
  every sample of the signal.
  

## Characterization of CT Signals

There are a few basic ways of characterizing signals.

* A CT signal is causal if $x(t) = 0$ $\forall t < 0$.
* A CT signal is anti-causal or acausal if $x(t) = 0$ $\forall t \geq 0$. A signal can be written as the sum of a causal and anti-causal signal.
* A CT signal is periodic if $x(t) = x(t + T)$ $\forall t$ for a fixed parameter $T \in \mathbb{R}$ called the \emph{period}. The simplest periodic signals are those based on the sinusoidal functions.
* A CT signal is even if $x(t) = x(-t)$ $\forall t$.
* A CT signal is odd if $x(t) = -x(-t)$ $\forall t$. 

  Any CT signal can be written in terms of an even and odd component
  $$
  x(t) = x_e(t) + x_o(t) 
  $$
  where $x_e(t) = \frac{1}{2}\left\{x(t) + x(-t)\right\}$ and $x_o(t) = \frac{1}{2}\left\{x(t) - x(-t)\right\}$.

## Characterization of CT Signals cont.

* The _energy_ of a CT signal $x(t)$ is defined as a measure of the function
  $$
  E_x = \lim_{T\rightarrow\infty} \int\limits_{-T}^T \lvert x(t) \rvert^2 dt \; .
  $$
* The _power_ of a CT signal is the energy averaged over an interval as that interval tends to infinity.
  $$
  P_x = \lim_{T\rightarrow\infty} \frac{1}{2T} \int_{-T}^T \lvert x(t)\rvert^2 dt \; .
  $$
 
Signals can be characterized based on their energy or power:

* Signals with finite, non-zero energy and zero power are called _energy signals_.
* Signals with finite, non-zero power (and by implication infinite energy) are called _power signals_.

## Characterization of DT Signals

Similarly there are a few basic ways of characterizing DT signals.

* A DT signal is *causal* if $x[n] = 0$ $\forall n < 0$.
* A DT signal is *anti-causal* or acausal if $x[n] = 0$ $\forall n \geq 0$.
* A DT signal can be written as the sum of a causal and anti-causal
signal.
* A DT signal is periodic if $x[n] = x[n + N] \; \forall n$ for a fixed
period $N \in \mathbb{Z}$.
* A DT signal is even if $x[n] = x[-n] \; \forall n$.
* A DT signal is odd if $x[n] = -x[-n] \; \forall n$.

  Any DT signal can be written in terms of an even and odd component
  $$x[n] = x_e[n] + x_o[n]$$ 
  where $x_e[n] = \frac{1}{2}\left\{x[n] + x[-n]\right\}$ and $x_o[n] = \frac{1}{2}\left\{x[n] - x[-n]\right\}$

## Characterization of DT Signals cont.

Analogous to CT signals, the energy of a DT signal is
$$E_x = \lim_{N\rightarrow\infty} \sum\limits_{-N}^N \lvert x[n]\rvert^2 \; .$$

The power of a DT signal is the energy averaged over an interval as
that interval tends to infinity.

$$P_x = \lim_{N\rightarrow\infty} \frac{1}{2N+1} \sum\limits_{-N}^N \lvert x[n]\rvert^2 \; .$$

DT Signals with finite, non-zero energy and zero power are called
*energy signals*. 

DT Signals with finite, non-zero power (and by
implication infinite energy) are called *power signals*.

## Systems

A system is an interconncted set of components or sub-systems. Mathematically a system is a transformation, $T$, between one or more signals, a rule that maps functions to functions.

* single input - single output (SISO) system.

  ![SISO Block Diagram ](figures/fig6_1.svg){fig-align="center" fig-alt="diagram showing the block diagram of a single-input, single-output system"}

* single input - multiple output (SIMO) system

  ![SIMO Block Diagram ](figures/fig6_2.svg){fig-align="center" fig-alt="diagram showing the block diagram of a single-input, multiple-output system"}

* general case, multiple input - multiple output (MIMO)

  ![MIMO Block Diagram ](figures/fig6_3.svg){fig-align="center" fig-alt="diagram showing the block diagram of a multiple-input, multiple-output system"}
  
We will focus on single input - single output systems.

## Systems cont.

- If both input and output are CT signals, it is a CT system.

  ![Generic Block Diagram of CT System](figures/fig6_4.svg){fig-align="center" fig-alt="diagram showing the block diagram of a CT system"}


- If both input and output are DT signals, it is a DT system.

  ![Generic Block Diagram of a DT System](figures/fig6_5.svg){fig-align="center" fig-alt="diagram showing the block diagram of a DT system"}

- If input and output are not both CT or DT signals, it is a hybrid
  CT-DT system.

  ![Generic Block Diagram of a Hybrid DT/CT System](figures/fig6_6.svg){fig-align="center" fig-alt="diagram showing the block diagram of a hybrid system with DT input and CT output"}
  
  ![Generic Block Diagram of a Hybrid CT/DT System](figures/fig6_7.svg){fig-align="center" fig-alt="diagram showing the block diagram of a hybrid system with CT input and DT output"}

We will focus on Hybrid and DT systems.

## System Input and Output

* The input to a SISO system is a signal.
* The output from a SISO system, or its _response_, is also a signal
* There are three canonical responses considered:
  * Impulse Response
  * Step Response
  * Complex Exponential or sinusoidal response

  For LTI systems the last two can be derived from the first.

* The impulse response for CT systems is denoted $h(t)$.

  ![Impulse Response of CT System](figures/figA_1.svg){fig-align="center" fig-alt="diagram showing the block diagram of a CT system with impulse as input"}
  
* The impulse response for DT systems is denoted $h[n]$.

  ![Impulse Response of DT System](figures/figA_2.svg){fig-align="center" fig-alt="diagram showing the block diagram of a DT system with impulse as input"}

## CT system representations

We can mathematically represent, or model, systems multiple ways.

* purely mathematically - in time domain we generically use
  - for CT systems: differential equations
    e.g. $$y^{\prime\prime} + ay^\prime + by = x$$
  - for DT systems: difference equations
    e.g. $$y[n] = a y[n-1] + b y[n-2] + x[n]$$
* graphically, using a mixture of math and block diagrams

Mathematical models:

- provide abstraction, removing (often) irrelevant detail.

- can be more or less detailed, an *internal* v.s. *external* (block
  box) description

- are not unique with respect to instantiation (implementation)

- are limited to the regime they were designed for

## System properties and classification

Choosing the right kind of system model is important. Here are some
important properties that allow us to broadly classify systems.

- Memory
- Invertability
- Causality
- Stability
- Time-invariance
- Linearity

Our focus is on linear, time-invariant (LTI) systems. Such systems can be represented completely by:

* an LCCDE,
* an impulse response, or 
* a transfer function.

When stable they can also be represented by thier frequency response.
